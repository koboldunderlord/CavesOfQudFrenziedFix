{"workshopId":1764893196,"Title":"Fix Frenzied","Description":"Fixes the Frenzied effect by actually allowing the duration to expire.\r\n\r\nUseful if you make friends with Snapjaws and ever fight alongside a Howler!\r\n\r\nNo extra actions needed if using this in a new game.\r\n\r\nIf you're loading this into an existing save file, please note that your party will not have this by default!\r\n\r\nTo add the FrenziedFix part to your existing game's party, you will have to use the Wish command. Assuming you haven't done this before, here are full instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Open Key bindings & attach Wish to a button\r\n2. In main play screen press Wish button\r\n3. Type \"effect:AddFrenziedFix\" (without the quotes)\r\n4. Move next to an ally without the fix\r\n5. Press the wish button and type \"swap\", then target your companion like you would move into their tile\r\n6. Press the wish button and type \"effect:AddFrenziedFix\"\r\n7. Press the wish button and type \"swap\", and direct towards your character\r\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 for all allies\n\n\n\nFinal note: This should be forwards compatible with any fix implemented.  The fix may break your game but you don't have to worry about remembering to remove the mod as it keeps track of the last duration it saw Frenzied have and will not reduce it again if it's different.","Tags":"frenzied,frenzy,snapjaw,effect","Visibility":"0","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
